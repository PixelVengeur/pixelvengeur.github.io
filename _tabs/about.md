## Hi :wave:
Name's Nathan! Or **Nate**, for short (not at all because I struggle with the `Ã¾` sound). I'm an Industrial Computer Science major, deeply in love with learning, especially in anything relating to computer science and homelabbing.

While I do host an internal documentation site, there is stuff I want to share, mostly the all-alusive "**WHY** does this work? And **WHY** does this not?". 

The pixelated trash bag that I use as an icon and favicon is Ser Junkan, a character from [Enter the Gungeon](https://enterthegungeon.com/), owned and copyrighted by Devolver Digital.
