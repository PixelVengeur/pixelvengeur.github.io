Earlier this year, I got a new work laptop, a Lenovo G16 IRL. As they tend to, laptops come with Windows preinstalled, with its activation key tied to the motherboard. However, for the past 8 months, I had been using Fedora Linux on my previous laptop, which I was very happy with. But this laptop has something more: a Windows Hello certification

##Â What is Windows Hello?
Windows Hello is a certification introduced by Microsoft that tells consumer a certain piece of equipment can be used to biometrically authenticate a user. The most prevalent forms of those equipments is the fingerprint scanner, and the facial recognition camera.

## Fingerprint reader
The easy way to get a fingerprint reader working on Linux is to use [fprint](https://fprint.freedesktop.org/). Unfortunately, the fingerprint scanner included in the G16 is not contained in the [officially supported hardware list](https://fprint.freedesktop.org/supported-devices.html). However, Lenovo has released a [proprietary driver](https://pcsupport.lenovo.com/us/en/products/laptops-and-netbooks/thinkpad-edge-laptops/thinkpad-e14-gen-4-type-21eb-and-21ec/downloads/ds563477-fpc-fingerprint-driver-for-ubuntu-2004-ubuntu-2204-thinkpad-e14-gen-4-e15-gen-4?category=Fingerprint+Reader) for this very fingerprint sensor (`10a5:9800`).
