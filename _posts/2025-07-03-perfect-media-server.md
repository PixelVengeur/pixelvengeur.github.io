I've been really happy running TrueNAS Scale in my lab. It has warned me every time a drive has failed, I have never lost any data, and the scrubs, resilvers, drive swaps, replications and snapshots have always worked flawlessly. But reliability is boring.

After being informed of it by [Wolfgang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyGbkEtjJ90), I thought that going the [Perfect Media Server](https://perfectmediaserver.com/) route would be great, if only for the "tiered storage", allowing for HDD spindown, and thus lowered power consumption.

# Hardware
I'm reusing most of my current server's hardware:
- A Xeon E3-1225v6 (4c/4t) on an [AsRock Rack E3C236D4M-4L](https://www.asrockrack.com/general/productdetail.asp?Model=E3C236D4M-4L#Specifications)
- 5 x 10 TB Seagate Exos ST10000NM0096
- A Samsung 650, 120GB SSD
- An LSI 9211-8i HBA
- A Mellanox ConnectX-3 10 GBit adapter
- And a Seasonic Focus Gold 850W PSU

However... I want tiered storage. So I'm going to need SSDs. Oh look at that, [a Level1Techs video about cheap enterprise SSDs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0APH46b3_0). So yeah, I picked up 4 x 800GB Toshiba branded `PX04SVB080`.

The plan
====
PMS (Perfect Media Server) uses a combination of MergerFS and Snapraid (for more information, check out the explanation on the technologies on [PMS' website](https://perfectmediaserver.com/02-tech-stack/mergerfs/)). The layout I'm going for is as follows:

```mermaid
architecture-beta
    group PMS(database)[MergerFS]

    group fasty(database)[ZFS] in PMS
    service ssd1(disk)[SSD 1] in fasty
    service ssd2(disk)[SSD 2] in fasty
    service ssd3(disk)[SSD 3] in fasty
    service ssd4(disk)[SSD 4] in fasty

    ssd1:R -- L:ssd2
    ssd2:R -- L:ssd3
    ssd3:R -- L:ssd4


    group snapraid(database)[SnapRaid] in PMS
    group rusty(database)[MergerFS] in snapraid

    service disk1(disk)[Disk 1] in rusty
    service disk2(disk)[Disk 2] in rusty
    service disk3(disk)[Disk 3] in rusty
    service disk4(disk)[Disk 4] in rusty
    service parity(disk)[Parity drive] in snapraid

    disk1:R -- L:disk2
    disk2:R -- L:disk3
    disk3:R -- L:disk4
    disk1{group}:L -- R:parity

    ssd2{group}:B --> T:disk2{group}

```

# Preparation
## Backing up from TrueNAS
The current TrueNAS pool is a 5-wide RAIDZ1 zfs pool. I like the idea of having 4 data drives and one parity, however, I unfortunately can't keep the zfs pool as is. Snapraid can absolutely utilize that layout, but it would mean keeping the 5 drive pool, and adding a 6th drive for parity. Which would be redundant, as ZFS also keeps a parity drive, which itself would also get parity checksums placed on the snapraid parity drive.

```mermaid
architecture-beta
    group PMS(database)[MergerFS]

    group fasty(database)[ZFS] in PMS
    service ssd1(disk)[SSD 1] in fasty
    service ssd2(disk)[SSD 2] in fasty
    service ssd3(disk)[SSD 3] in fasty
    service ssd4(disk)[SSD 4] in fasty

    ssd1:R -- L:ssd2
    ssd2:R -- L:ssd3
    ssd3:R -- L:ssd4


    group snapraid(database)[SnapRaid] in PMS
    group rusty(database)[ZFS] in snapraid

    service disk1(disk)[Disk 1] in rusty
    service disk2(disk)[Disk 2] in rusty
    service disk3(disk)[Disk 3] in rusty
    service disk4(disk)[Disk 4] in rusty
    service disk5(disk)[ZFS parity] in rusty
    service parity(disk)[Parity drive] in snapraid

    disk1:R -- L:disk2
    disk2:R -- L:disk3
    disk3:R -- L:disk4
    disk4:R -- L:disk5
    disk1{group}:L -- R:parity

    ssd2{group}:B --> T:disk2{group}

```

It would be much easier to migrate, for sure, but adding an extra drive for fun, and getting 2/3rds drive efficiency does feel inefficient. So I have no choice but to backup my pool, break the RAIDZ1, format each drive to a new filesystem (XFS in my case), create the MergerFS pool and only then transfer everything back. This will prove to be fun. Thankfully I already own the drives I need to backup my base pool. so no need to buy anything there.

## Formatting NetApp drives
The `PX04SVB080` drives that I bought came in a NetApp drive tray, which houses an interposer for SAS to SATA, among others. NetApp, in their infinite wisdom, only accept drives formatted to a 520b (emulated) sector size, which is non-standard. For better compatibility with *everything else*, I will need to [format the drives to a more widespread sector size](https://www.truenas.com/community/threads/troubleshooting-disk-format-warnings-in-truenas-scale.106051/). For these drives, it will be 4096b (aka 4Kn, their native sector size).
